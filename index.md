*This post addresses the following prompts:*  
    - *What do you think being a data scientist is about?  
    - What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?  
    - What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?  
    - How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?*


### What does is mean to be a data scientist?

Unwrapping what it is that a data scientist does can be confusing when comparing it to other careers, such as a data analyst, a statistician, or a machine learning expert. A data scientist is really a combination of these *three* things because they need to understand how to run analytics, how to interpret their findings, & how to apply those findings to help answer a question or solve a problem for a business or client. It's important for a data scientist to be more than just a good programmer, but someone who understands statistics and how to apply that knowledge to the real-world scenario at hand as well.

The job of a data scientist and statistician overlap in many respects; however, the primary difference between them is that a data scientist more often applies their knowledge of statistics using machine learning and programming skills.

Personally, I find myself much more inclined towards a profession as a data scientist because I find work particularly rewarding when it benefits society in some way. The ability to connect with a business or client and potentially help improve their business model would be of great interest to me. I have found the courses I have taken throughout the NCSU Master's of Statistics program to prepare me to pursue either of these professions.
