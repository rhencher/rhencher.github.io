## A final reflection  

*This post addresses the following prompts:*  
*What things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?  
Data science (and statistics) is a huge field. What do you hope to do in relation to data science (and statistics) in your future career? What aspects/areas do you want to learn more about?*  

Having used R successfully in several courses prior to this one, I honestly wasn't sure how much I would gain from this course when I enrolled, but felt that it was immensely important to build a more solid foundation. Upon reflection, it is hard to believe that I felt like my knowledge of R was in fact sufficient! While I was able to create models, compare them, produce summary statistics, etc., I had entirely missed out on how to create useful graphics and plots, how to create apps, how to manipulate data sets, and even the basics of how to format text in order to make a report look nice. Overall, I have found this course to be *immensely* useful and am already reaping the benefits of my newfound knowledge in other coursework.
